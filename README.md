# js-training-namespaces
Check out the beginning of the file main.js. There you'll find the Assignment. The same assignment is listed below:

0) First go through example.html and js/example folders. Look at all the examples, study them and try to apply them in the solution.

Assignment:
1) Use namespaces to divide the code, for each new namespace, use a new file!
2) Try to decide on yourself which namespace technique fits the best here!
   2a) Do not use: Direct Assignment, Object Literal Notation
   2b) Pick one of: IIFE Variations, Module Pattern Variations
   2c) If you want to challenge yourself, try using RequireJS or ES6 Import Exports
3) Look at what the functions do and try to find a commonality to pick a namespace name
4) Don't concern yourself too much with the HTML, it's secondary here --> although the result should
   look the same after dividing up your code
5) Check the js/example folders and example/example.html HTML - File to view examples of different namespaceing techniques
